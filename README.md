<h2>A chess game created using JavaScript.</h2>

<p>This chess game was created using JavaScript. It is a project that shows and helps you to understand how to create the game board, the chess pieces, reset button to restart the game, and the functionality that needs to be created to move each piece where it can go and cannot go as well as the switching between players' turn. I created this following the tutorial of Ania Kub√≥w but have changed the chess pieces functionality, the css styles, and have added a reset button.</p>
